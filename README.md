# Colour-recognizing-neural-network
A modifiable neural network platform using gradient descent that is configured to recognize colours.

# Info on running the network
I made this network in VSCode, but it is compiled using the .NET Core, so you probably don't need to use VSCode to run it.

So far, I have tested this on macOS and Ubuntu machines, and both work correctly.
